## AASTUGRAM

### General Guidelines to accessing the Website

- To access the landing page, navigate to aastugram/App/views folder and open the landing_page.php file.
- 	To access the admin panel, navigate to aastugram/App/views/admin folder and then open the login.php file use :
--username: - Software Department
--password: - sweg@aastu
--
- All the Tables are to be found on the attached .sql files
--Name of the Database: - aastugram
--Password: - 
-For login into main page use email:- estifmitiku@gmail.com
-For password use :- ayeleayele
-In php mailer, set the email to antzemz@gmail.com and password as Michaelgashaw66@
-Since the RAR file was too big, we had to separate the Resources from the functional Interface so we've sent two different RAR files - Apps and Resources - add them to a folder named aastugram


### Possible Errors
-Email sent for verification might not be in inbox
-In functionalities like liking, disliking, posting etc. … , since the majority of the functions are done in JavaScript and finishing the functionality using PHP has become difficult so we’ve reserved our option for server side posting and for the mean time have settled for only local groups until we gain more understanding on it. 
-Some reports on admin page might be on dummy reports since a template was used.
