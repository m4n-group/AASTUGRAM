    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p> This Privacy Policy sets out how we, AASTUGRAM, use and protect your personal data that
      you provide to us, or that is otherwise obtained or generated by us, in connection with your use of our
      web-based services. For the purposes of this Privacy Policy, ‘we’, ‘us’ and ‘our’ refers to
      AASTUGRAM, and ‘you’ refers to you, the user of the Services.</p>

    <h1>Privacy Principles</h1>
    <p>AASTUGRAM has two fundamental principles when it comes to collecting and processing private data:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>We don't use your data to show you ads.</li>
      <li>We only store the data that AASTUGRAM needs to function as a secure and feature-rich messaging
        service.</li>
    </ul>

    <h1> Terms of Service </h1>
    <p>This Privacy Policy forms part of our Terms of Service, which describes the terms under
      which you use our Services and which are available . This Privacy Policy should therefore
      be read in conjunction with those terms. </p>

    <h2>Legal Ground for Processing Your Personal Data</h2>
    We process your personal data on the ground that such processing is necessary to further our legitimate
    interests including:<br>
    <ol>
      <li>providing effective and innovative Services to our users and </li>
      <li>to detect, prevent or otherwise address fraud or security issues in respect of our provision of
        Services),
        unless those interests are overridden by your interest or fundamental rights and freedoms that require
        protections of personal data.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>What Personal Data We Use</h2>
    AASTUGRAM is a communication service. You provide your mobile number and basic account data (which may
    include profile name, profile picture and about information) to create a AASTUGRAM account. To make it
    easier for your contacts and other people to reach you and recognize who you are, the screen name you
    choose, your profile pictures, and your username (should you choose to set one) on AASTUGRAM are always public.
